Amplication uses _Plugins_ to extend the functionality of your generated code.

Some plugins can be enabled when you first create your service.
For example, if you choose MySQL as your database, the _MySQL DB_ plugin will be enabled.
If you choose to turn on authentication for your service, that will enable the _NestJS Auth Module_ plugin.

All official plugins published by Amplication are available on the _All Plugins_ page.
Your installed plugins are shown on the _Installed Plugins_ page.
Plugins can be manually enabled or disabled on either of these pages.

Besides official plugins created by the Amplication team, you can [develop your own custom plugins](/plugins/overview/), or you can use plugins developed by the community.

## Available Official Plugins

The plugins below are the ones that are currently available.
To see a list of all plugins on your Amplication dashboard, [visit your service's _All Plugins_ page](#how-to-install-a-plugin).
Additional plugins will be added in future releases of Amplication.

### Mongo DB

Use a Mongo database in your service generated by Amplication.

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. It is classified as a NoSQL database program, meaning that it does not use the traditional SQL relational database management system (RDBMS). Instead, it uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas to store data.

### PostgreSQL DB

Use a PostgreSQL database in your service generated by Amplication.

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is designed to be highly scalable, reliable, and powerful. It is known for its ability to handle large amounts of data and a high volume of queries.

### MySQL DB

Use a MySQL database in your service generated by Amplication.

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used in web applications and other software platforms. It is known for its reliability, simplicity, and performance. It is a powerful tool for storing and managing data in a structured and organized way.

### Apache Kafka

Use an Apache Kafka message broker to communicate between your services.

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is a distributed streaming platform, used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is a publish-subscribe messaging system that allows for the creation of high-throughput and low-latency systems.

In the Apache Kafka messaging system, processes known as producers write data to Kafka topics, and processes known as consumers read data from Kafka topics.

### NestJS NATS

Use a NestJS NATS message broker to communicate between your services.

[NATS](https://docs.nestjs.com/microservices/nats) is a high performance, low latency messaging system that is lightweight.
It follows a publish-subscribe model like Kafka but is less complex and easier to set up.
NATS is ideal for applications that require real-time messaging but don't need the level of durability and fault-tolerance that Kafka provides.

:::info
A _User_ entity must exist in order to enable this plugin in your project.
Learn [how to add the user entity](/how-to/add-delete-user-entity) into your service.
:::

### JWT Auth Provider

Add JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication and authorization to your service.

[NestJS's Passport based JWT authentication](https://docs.nestjs.com/security/authentication) involves the client sending a request to the server with a user's credentials in the form of a username and password. The server then authenticates the user and issues a JWT if the credentials are valid. This allows the client to authenticate subsequent requests to the server using the JWT.

:::note
The _NestJS Auth Provider_ plugin must also be installed to use the JWT Auth Provider plugin.
:::

### Passport Basic Authentication

Basic authentication is a simple authentication scheme built into the HTTP protocol that involves sending a request to a server with a user's credentials in the form of a username and password. The credentials are encoded in base64 and included in the Authorization header of the request.

:::note
The _NestJS Auth Provider_ plugin must also be installed to use the Passport Basic Authentication plugin.
:::

### Prettier

Prettify your app's code generated by Amplication.

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) is an opinionated code formatter that automatically formats your code to ensure adherence to a consistent style. Code is automatically formatted every time it is committed.

### GitHub Actions

Add a GitHub Actions workflow to your service.

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) allow you to customize your software development workflows right from your GitHub repositories.

### Swagger ApiBody

Add NestJS Api Swagger decorator to your service.

The OpenAPI specification is a language-agnostic definition format used to describe RESTful APIs. [Nest provides a dedicated module](https://docs.nestjs.com/openapi/introduction) which allows generating such a specification by leveraging decorators.

This plugin will specifically allow you to specify the structure of the request payload for create (POST) and update (PUT/PATCH) actions.

### Helm Chart

Adds a Helm Chart for your service.

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) uses a packaging format called charts. A Helm chart is a package that contains all the necessary resources to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster.

## How To Install A Plugin

1.  In the _All Plugins_ page, click **Install** for the required plugin.

![](./assets/all-plugins.png)

2. This will turn on the plugin's toggle into its _on_ state.

3. Go to the _Installed Plugins_ page. The installed plugins are listed.

4. To see the plugin's code on GitHub, select **View on GitHub**.

## How To Uninstall A Plugin

To uninstall, or deactivate, a plugin, click the toggle switch into its _off_ state.

## How To Modify Plugin Execution Order

The plugins are executed when Amplication generates code, according to their order on the *Installed Plugins* page.

:::tip
If a plugin execution is a prerequisite for another plugin, it must be located earlier in the list.
:::

- To change the order of the installed plugins, click the up or down arrow to the right of the plugin bar.

## How To Change a Plugin's Version

Amplication plugin developers may release several versions of a plugin over time.
Sometimes, you might need to generate a project with an earlier version of the plugin, to ensure compatibility.

By default, the latest version of the plugin will be available in the list of plugins.

1. To change the installed version of a plugin, in the **All Plugins** page, click the **Settings** icon.

   The plugin’s settings page opens.

   ![](./assets/plugin-versions.png)

2. Select the required plugin version from the Plugin version drop-down list and click **Save**.

   In the next build, the code will be generated with the selected plugin version.

:::note
Each version of the Plugin has its own settings, so when you replace the version you also replace its settings.

## How To Develop a Custom Plugin

To add more functionality, you can develop your own plugins, or can use plugins developed by the community, as they become available.

See [Plugin Development Overview](/plugins/overview/) for more information.
