To deploy to Docker, build a Docker image and run a Docker container.

Your project is always generated with all the configuration and scripts needed to build a Docker container to prepare your app for deployment.

First clone source code from your repository. See [Sync with GitHub](https://docs.amplication.com/sync-with-github/) for more information about working with source code.

To run your app in Docker with a functional database, execute the docker-compose command:

`docker-compose up`

TIP:
If you store your services in a monorepo git repository, run `docker-compose up` from within the service folder you want to run.
