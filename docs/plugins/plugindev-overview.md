# Plugin Development Overview

A plugin is a custom code that extends Amplication developer platform with new features. The features incorporated can be generic, useful to a wide variety of users, or can be very specific to deal with specialized requirements.

If you or your organization have a specific workflow, install an existing plugin or write one to customize the platform to perform your required tasks.

The plugin is published as an NPM package. It is then installed and executed as part of the code generation process to allow the plugin writer to manipulate and extend the default behavior.

All published plugins are available on the **All Plugins** page on the Amplication interface. All plugins installed on a particular service are available in the **Installed Plugins** page.
