## Context

In each lifecycle function (before and after), we have access to a global object called **context** which holds common data between event

## Skip Default Behavior

In the `before` function, you can call the `skipDefaultBehavior` from the context and set it to true (by default its value is false):

```tsx
context.utils.skipDefaultBehavior = true;
```

As a result, the default functionality wonâ€™t be executed and you will have to provide your own logic. You can do it after the skip in the `before` function, or in the `after` function.

:::important

Using `skipDefaultBehavior` and not providing an alternative functionality can cause unexpected behavior. For example, if the skipped event generates files that are imported from other files, so use it wisely and carefully.
