# How To Commit Changes

While working in Amplication your changes are saved automatically, but are not committed. Only committed changes will be included in the next version of your application.

In the _Pending Changes_ control in the main menu (left sidebar) you can see how many pending changes are waiting to be committed.

1. In the _commit message_ dialog, write a description of the changes you're committing.
2. Click **Commit Changes**. All changes are committed. A new build of your app is automatically created!
